# Project Setup Guide

## ✅ Fixed Issues

The following issues have been resolved:

1. **Client/Server Component Boundary Issues**: Fixed the root layout to properly handle client components by creating a `RootLayoutWrapper` that includes the necessary providers (`ThemeProvider` and `PageHeaderProvider`).

2. **Dependencies**: All npm dependencies are installed and up to date.

3. **Development Server**: The Next.js development server is running successfully on port 3000.

## 🔧 Required Setup Steps

### 1. Environment Variables

You need to create a `.env.local` file in the project root with your Supabase credentials:

```bash
# Create .env.local file
touch .env.local
```

Add the following content to `.env.local`:

```env
# Supabase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
```

#### How to get Supabase credentials:
1. Go to [https://supabase.com/dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
2. Select your project (or create a new one)
3. Go to Settings > API
4. Copy the URL and anon/public key

### 2. Database Setup

The application expects certain database tables to exist. You may need to:

1. Check the `database/schema.sql` file for the required schema
2. Run any migration scripts in the `scripts/` directory
3. Set up the required tables in your Supabase project

## 🚀 Current Status

- ✅ Development server running on http://localhost:3000
- ✅ Client/server component issues resolved  
- ✅ Bootstrap script error fixed
- ✅ Dependencies installed
- ✅ Application loads successfully with login screen
- ⚠️ Supabase configuration needed (will show connection error until configured)

## 🔍 Next Steps

1. Set up the `.env.local` file with your Supabase credentials
2. Configure your Supabase database with the required schema
3. The application should work fully once the database is connected

## 🎯 Authentication

The application uses a simple password-based authentication:
- Password: `kudosity`
- This will redirect you to `/overview` after login
