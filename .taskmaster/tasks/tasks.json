First, analyze the current navigation implementations in:\n   - MainLayout.tsx\n   - MainNav.tsx\n   - components/navigation/Sidebar.tsx\n   - config/navigation.ts\n\n2. Create a centralized navigation configuration:\n   - Create a new file `src/lib/navigation/config.ts` that defines a single navigation schema\n   - The schema should support all current navigation features (routes, nested items, icons, permissions, etc.)\n   - Example structure:\n   ```typescript\n   export type NavigationItem = {\n     id: string;\n     label: string;\n     path?: string;\n     icon?: React.ComponentType<any>;\n     children?: NavigationItem[];\n     permissions?: string[];\n     isExternal?: boolean;\n   };\n\n   export const navigationConfig: NavigationItem[] = [\n     // Main navigation items\n   ];\n   ```\n\n3. Implement the useNavigation() hook:\n   - Create `src/lib/navigation/useNavigation.ts`\n   - The hook should provide access to the navigation structure\n   - Include filtering by permissions, active state detection, and other common operations\n   - Example implementation:\n   ```typescript\n   export function useNavigation() {\n     const router = useRouter();\n     const { user } = useAuth();\n     \n     // Filter navigation items based on user permissions\n     const filteredNavigation = useMemo(() => {\n       return filterNavigationByPermissions(navigationConfig, user?.permissions || []);\n     }, [navigationConfig, user?.permissions]);\n     \n     // Determine active navigation item based on current route\n     const activeItem = useMemo(() => {\n       return findActiveNavigationItem(filteredNavigation, router.pathname);\n     }, [filteredNavigation, router.pathname]);\n     \n     return {\n       navigation: filteredNavigation,\n       activeItem,\n       isActive: (itemId: string) => activeItem?.id === itemId,\n     };\n   }\n   ```\n\n4. Refactor existing components:\n   - Update MainLayout.tsx to use the new hook\n   - Refactor MainNav.tsx to consume the navigation from the hook\n   - Update Sidebar.tsx to use the unified navigation\n   - Remove or deprecate the navigation logic in config/navigation.ts\n\n5. Add utility functions for common navigation operations:\n   - Filtering by permissions\n   - Finding active items\n   - Flattening nested navigation\n   - Breadcrumb generation\n\n6. Document the new navigation system with JSDoc comments and create a README.md file explaining the usage patterns.",

Unit Tests:\n   - Create unit tests for the useNavigation() hook using React Testing Library\n   - Test permission-based filtering with different user roles\n   - Test active item detection with various route scenarios\n   - Test all utility functions with different navigation structures\n\n2. Integration Tests:\n   - Verify that MainLayout.tsx correctly renders navigation based on the hook\n   - Test that MainNav.tsx and Sidebar.tsx display the correct navigation items\n   - Ensure route changes update the active navigation state correctly\n   - Test that breadcrumbs are generated correctly from the navigation structure\n\n3. Visual Regression Tests:\n   - Compare screenshots of the navigation components before and after the refactor\n   - Ensure the UI appearance remains consistent across all navigation components\n\n4. Manual Testing:\n   - Navigate through the application and verify all navigation items work correctly\n   - Test with different user roles to ensure permission-based filtering works\n   - Verify that active states are correctly highlighted in the UI\n   - Check that mobile and desktop navigation variants work as expected\n\n5. Code Review Checklist:\n   - Ensure all previous navigation logic has been properly migrated\n   - Verify that no duplicate navigation definitions exist\n   - Check that the hook API is intuitive and well-documented\n   - Confirm that the navigation schema is flexible enough for future requirements",

MASSIVE CODE DUPLICATION**\n- **MainLayout.tsx** and **Sidebar.tsx** contain **IDENTICAL navigation logic**\n- Same state management: `expandedItems`, `selectedItem`\n- Same functions: `navigateToSubitem()`, `toggleExpanded()`, `handleMenuItemClick()`\n- Same route initialization useEffect\n- Same rendering patterns\n- **Result**: ~100 lines of duplicated code\n\n#### **2. CONFLICTING DATA SOURCES**\n- **MainLayout.tsx & Sidebar.tsx**: Use `config/navigation.ts` (hierarchical structure, 7 categories)\n- **MainNav.tsx**: Uses own hardcoded `navigationItems` array (flat structure, 23 items)\n- **Result**: Two completely different navigation structures in same app\n\n#### **3. INCONSISTENT NAVIGATION ITEMS**\n**config/navigation.ts structure:**\n- 7 main categories: Dashboards, Audience, Messaging, Campaigns, Automation, Developers, Settings\n- 23 total subitems organized hierarchically\n\n**MainNav.tsx structure:**\n- 23 flat navigation items with direct hrefs\n- Different organization, some missing items, some extra items\n- No hierarchy, just flat list\n\n#### **4. ROUTE MAPPING INCONSISTENCIES**\n- **config/navigation.ts**: `getRouteFromSubitem()` with special case handling\n- **MainNav.tsx**: Direct href property mapping\n- **Result**: Different route generation approaches, potential conflicts\n\n#### **5. UNCLEAR COMPONENT USAGE**\n- Multiple navigation components with overlapping functionality\n- No clear indication which should be used where\n- MainLayout includes embedded sidebar vs separate Sidebar component\n\n### **SPECIFIC ISSUES IDENTIFIED:**\n\n**Duplicated State Management:**\n```typescript\n// Found in BOTH MainLayout.tsx AND Sidebar.tsx\nconst [expandedItems, setExpandedItems] = useState<string[]>([])\nconst [selectedItem, setSelectedItem] = useState<string | null>(null)\n```\n\n**Duplicated Route Logic:**\n```typescript\n// Identical 25-line useEffect in both files\nuseEffect(() => {\n  const currentPath = pathname\n  let found = false\n  // ... exact same logic\n}, [pathname])\n```\n\n**Navigation Data Conflicts:**\n- config/navigation.ts has \"Data-Sources\" subitem\n- MainNav.tsx has both \"Data Sources\" AND separate \"Database\" items\n- Different icons, different routes, same functionality\n\n### **IMPACT ASSESSMENT:**\n- üî¥ **High Maintenance Cost**: Changes require updates in multiple places\n- üî¥ **Inconsistent UX**: Different navigation experiences depending on component used  \n- üî¥ **Developer Confusion**: Unclear which navigation system to use/modify\n- üî¥ **Bundle Size**: Unnecessary code duplication\n- üî¥ **Bug Risk**: Updates in one place but not others cause inconsistencies\n\n### **RECOMMENDED CONSOLIDATION STRATEGY:**\n1. **Eliminate MainNav.tsx** - Replace with unified system\n2. **Merge Sidebar.tsx logic into hook** - Remove duplication\n3. **Extend config/navigation.ts** - Make it the single source of truth\n4. **Standardize route mapping** - One consistent approach\n5. **Create useNavigation() hook** - Encapsulate all navigation logic\n</info added on 2025-08-04T00:24:49.644Z>",

The problem stemmed from a combination of factors:\n\n1. The useProfileForm hook was not properly passing the save callback to the ProfileHeader component\n2. The compatibility wrapper was intercepting but not forwarding save events\n3. Form state synchronization was broken between the new decomposed components\n\nFix implemented:\n- Modified useProfileForm.ts to correctly handle and propagate save operations\n- Updated the compatibility wrapper to properly forward save events\n- Implemented proper state sharing between ContactPropertiesForm and CustomFieldsSection\n- Added explicit event bubbling for save operations from child components\n- Fixed prop types in ProfileHeader.tsx to correctly accept and handle save callbacks\n\nAll changes have been tested with both new and legacy code paths. The profile save functionality is now working correctly with 100% backward compatibility.

End-to-End Tests:\n   - Create E2E tests for the complete list workflow:\n     - Creating a list\n     - Adding profiles manually\n     - Adding profiles via CSV import\n     - Creating a segment based on list membership\n     - Verifying segment results\n   - Test performance with large lists (1000+ members)\n\n5. API Tests:\n   - Test all list-related API endpoints\n     - Verify correct responses for valid requests\n     - Test error handling for invalid requests\n     - Test authorization (only authorized users can manage lists)\n\n6. Manual Testing Checklist:\n   - Verify list creation, editing, and deletion\n   - Test adding and removing individual profiles from lists\n   - Test bulk operations for list management\n   - Verify CSV import with list tagging\n   - Test list-based segment filtering\n   - Verify UI consistency and adherence to design system",
