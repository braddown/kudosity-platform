## Agent Coordination Principles

1. **Domain Separation**: Each agent focuses on their expertise area without overlap
2. **Cross-Agent Collaboration**: Complex issues may require multiple agent perspectives
3. **Consistency First**: All agents prioritize maintaining system-wide consistency
4. **Quality Gates**: Each agent defines quality standards for their domain
5. **Documentation**: All recommendations should be documented and traceable

## Integration with Development Workflow

- **Before Starting**: Review relevant agent guidelines
- **During Development**: Apply agent-specific best practices
- **Before Committing**: Validate against agent quality standards
- **During Reviews**: Use agent documentation as review criteria

## Maintenance

This agent system should be updated when:
- New technologies are adopted
- Architecture patterns change
- Quality standards evolve
- New compliance requirements emerge

Each agent documentation should be treated as living documentation that evolves with the project.
