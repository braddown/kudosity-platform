// 1. config/navigation.ts has multiple exports:
//    - navigationItems (flat list)
//    - settingsItems
//    - navItems (grouped with subitems)

// 2. components/navigation/Sidebar.tsx uses navItems from config/navigation
// 3. components/MainLayout.tsx also uses navItems from config/navigation
// 4. There's also components/navigation/AppLayout.tsx which might be unused

// Let's identify what's actually being used and clean this up

const currentNavigationSystems = {

    navigationItems: "Flat list - possibly unused",

  "components/navigation/AppLayout.tsx": "Separate system - possibly duplicate",

logger.debug("Current systems:", currentNavigationSystems)

// The issue: Multiple navigation systems are conflicting
// Solution: Use ONE consistent system throughout
