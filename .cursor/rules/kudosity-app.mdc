## CRITICAL: Version Control Rules

- **NEVER push to GitHub without explicit user instruction**
  - ❌ DO NOT run `git push` unless the user explicitly says "push to GitHub" or similar
  - ❌ DO NOT commit code unless the user explicitly requests it
  - ✅ ONLY make code changes and wait for testing confirmation
  - ✅ WAIT for user to say when to commit and when to push
  - The user will test all changes before any commits to ensure code quality

## Database Configuration

- Supabase project is hgfsmeudhvsvwmzxexmv
- Always use Supabase MCP server when dealing with the database
