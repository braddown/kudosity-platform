## Implementation Phases

Each phase can be executed by AI agents in parallel where dependencies allow. No specific timelines are provided as AI agents work continuously and can handle multiple tasks simultaneously.

## Quick Start Tasks

Priority tasks for immediate implementation:

1. Design and implement database schema
2. Create Supabase migrations for core tables
3. Set up Supabase Auth with email/password
4. Build basic login/signup pages
5. Implement organization context
6. Update Settings pages to use real data
7. Replace hardcoded user references with actual user info

## Notes
