# Profile Update Display and Activity Logging Fix

## Problems Fixed

### 1. Profile Data Not Refreshing After Save
**Issue**: After saving a recipient profile, the old data would display until the page was manually refreshed.

**Cause**: The save function was checking for `data.length` but the API returns a single object, not an array.

**Fix**: Updated the response handling in `useProfileForm` hook:
```typescript
// Before: if (onProfileUpdate && data && data.length > 0)
// After: if (onProfileUpdate && data)

// Before: onProfileUpdate(data[0])
// After: onProfileUpdate(data)
```

### 2. Activity History Not Being Logged
**Issue**: Profile changes weren't being recorded in the activity history.

**Cause**: Activity logging was using direct Supabase calls which bypassed authentication context.

**Fix**: Created a proper API endpoint for activity logging.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Created Activity Logging API
**File**: `app/api/cdp-profiles/[id]/activity/route.ts`

Features:
- `POST` endpoint to log activities
- `GET` endpoint to fetch activity history
- Proper authentication and account validation
- Automatically captures the user who made the change
- Includes user's name (not just ID) in the activity source

### 2. Updated Profile Form Hook
**File**: `lib/hooks/use-profile-form.ts`

Changes:
- Activity logging now uses the API endpoint
- Property updates are logged with full context
- Consent changes are tracked for compliance
- User attribution is automatic (no more hardcoded names)

### 3. Added RLS Policies for Activity Log
Created proper Row-Level Security policies:
- Users can view activity for profiles in their account
- Users can insert activity for profiles in their account
- Ensures activity logs are properly secured

## Benefits

1. **Immediate UI Updates**: Profile changes now reflect immediately after saving
2. **Complete Activity Tracking**: All changes are logged with:
   - Who made the change (actual user)
   - What was changed (property name and values)
   - When it was changed (timestamp)
   - Why it was changed (description)
3. **Security**: Activity logging goes through authenticated API
4. **Compliance**: Consent changes are properly tracked for GDPR/privacy requirements

## Testing

1. Edit a recipient profile
2. Make changes to any fields
3. Click "Save"
4. Verify:
   - ✅ Changes appear immediately (no refresh needed)
   - ✅ Success toast notification appears
   - ✅ Activity is logged in the Activity History section
   - ✅ Activity shows the correct user who made the change

## Future Enhancements

- Add pagination for activity history
- Add filtering by activity type
- Add export functionality for compliance reporting
- Add real-time activity updates via WebSockets
