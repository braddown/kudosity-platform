# Activity Logging - Complete and Working

## Date: 2025-08-12

## Status: ✅ FULLY FUNCTIONAL

## What's Working Now

### 1. Recipient Profile Activity (✅ Working)
- Activities are saved when profiles are updated
- Activity History displays correctly on profile pages
- Shows who made changes and when
- Updates immediately after saving

### 2. User Activity Logging (✅ Working)
- RLS policies fixed - activities can now be saved
- User Profile page shows activities
- Settings > Users > Activity Log shows all account activities
- Both pages pull from the same `user_activity_log` table
- Activities refresh when switching tabs
- Activities update immediately after profile changes

## All Fixes Applied

### 1. API Route Authentication Fix
```javascript
// Before: const supabase = createClient()
// After:  const supabase = await createClient()
```

### 2. RLS Policy Fix for user_activity_log
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can insert their own activities"
ON user_activity_log FOR INSERT
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can view all activities in their account"
ON user_activity_log FOR SELECT
TO authenticated
USING (
  account_id IN (
    SELECT account_id 
    FROM account_members 
    WHERE user_id = auth.uid() 
    AND status = 'active'
  )
);
```

### 3. UI Improvements
- Added activity refresh when switching tabs in Settings > Users
- Added immediate activity refresh after profile updates
- Properly formatted activity types (e.g., "profile_updated" → "Profile Updated")
- Removed default/mock data when real activities exist

## Data in Database

The following activities are now being tracked:
- User profile updates
- Recipient profile updates  
- Login activities
- Account creation

Sample data verified in database:
- 5+ activities in `user_activity_log`
- 30+ activities in `profile_activity_log`

## How to Test

1. **Update Your User Profile**
   - Go to User Profile (top-right dropdown)
   - Change any field and save
   - Activity appears immediately in "Recent Activity"

2. **Update a Recipient Profile**
   - Go to any recipient profile
   - Make changes and save
   - Activity appears in profile's "Activity History"
   - Also logged to user activity

3. **Check Settings > Users > Activity Log**
   - Navigate to Settings > Users
   - Click "Activity Log" tab
   - Shows all user activities in the account
   - Refreshes when you switch tabs

- `/api/cdp-profiles/[id]/activity` - GET and POST profile activities

### Database Tables
- `user_activity_log` - All user actions
- `profile_activity_log` - Recipient profile changes

### Key Files Modified
- `app/settings/users/page.tsx` - Added activity refresh on tab change
- `app/profile/page.tsx` - Added immediate activity refresh after save
- `app/api/user-activity/route.ts` - Fixed authentication
- `app/api/cdp-profiles/[id]/activity/route.ts` - Fixed authentication
- RLS policies for both activity tables

## Verification
✅ Activities are being saved (verified in terminal logs)
✅ Activities are stored in database (verified via SQL queries)
✅ Activities display in UI (verified in screenshots)
✅ Activities refresh immediately (no page reload needed)
✅ Tab switching refreshes data
✅ Both User Profile and Settings > Users show the same data
