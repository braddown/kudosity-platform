# Detailed Activity Logging Implementation

## Date: 2025-08-12

## Overview
Enhanced the activity logging system to provide detailed audit trails showing exactly what fields were changed, from what value to what value.

## Changes Made

### 1. Recipient Profile Updates
- Now logs specific field changes with "from → to" format
- Example: `Updated recipient profile: Brad Down - Changed: First Name: "Bradley" → "Brad", Location: "Sydney" → "Melbourne"`
- Includes metadata about all changed fields
- Properly formats complex values (objects, arrays, booleans)

### 2. User Profile Updates  
- Tracks changes to first_name, last_name, mobile_number, country, timezone
- Shows before and after values for each field
- Example: `Updated user profile - Changed: Mobile Number: "Empty" → "+61412345678", Timezone: "Sydney" → "Melbourne"`

### 3. Value Formatting
- Empty/null values display as "Empty"
- Boolean values display as "Yes" or "No"
- Arrays show count: "[3 items]"
- Objects show property count: "[Object with 5 properties]"
- Long strings truncated to 50 characters with "..."

## Activity Log Display

### User Activity Log (Settings > Users > Activity Log)
Shows:
- Activity type (e.g., "Recipient Profile Updated")
- Who performed the action
- Detailed description with all changes
- Timestamp

### Profile Activity History (on recipient profiles)
Shows:
- Specific field that was changed
- Old value → New value
- Who made the change
- Timestamp

## Benefits for Administrators

1. **Audit Trail**: Complete visibility into what was changed
2. **Accountability**: Clear record of who changed what and when
3. **Debugging**: Easy to trace issues back to specific changes
4. **Compliance**: Detailed logs for regulatory requirements
5. **User Behavior**: Understanding how users interact with the system

## Example Activity Entries

### Before (Generic):
```
Updated recipient profile: Brad Down
```

### After (Detailed):

#### Simple Field Changes:
```
Updated recipient profile: Brad Down - Changed: First Name: "Bradley" → "Brad", Email: "bradley@example.com" → "brad@kudosity.com"
```

#### Notification Preferences Changes:
```
Updated recipient profile: Brad Down - Changed: Notification Preferences: Marketing email: Off → On, Transactional sms: On → Off
```

#### Custom Fields Changes:
```
Updated recipient profile: Brad Down - Changed: Custom Fields: Company Size: "10-50" → "50-100", Industry: "Empty" → "Technology"
```

#### Mixed Changes:
```
Updated recipient profile: Brad Down - Changed: First Name: "Brad" → "Bradley", Custom Fields: Data Quality Score: "85" → "10", Os: "iOS 17" → "iOS 16"
```

## Technical Implementation

- Modified `lib/hooks/use-profile-form.ts` to track and format field changes
- Updated `app/profile/page.tsx` for user profile change tracking
- Enhanced activity description to include detailed change summary
- Added metadata to store structured change information
- Improved value formatting for different data types

## Testing
1. Update a recipient profile - check activity shows specific fields changed
2. Update user profile - check activity shows what was modified
3. Check Settings > Users > Activity Log - verify detailed descriptions
4. Make multiple changes at once - verify all changes are captured
