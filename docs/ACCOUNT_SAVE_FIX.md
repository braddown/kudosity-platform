# Account Settings Save Fix

## Problem
The Account settings page (`/settings/account`) was not saving changes, while the User Profile page was working correctly.

## Root Cause
The `accounts` table had overly restrictive Row-Level Security (RLS) policies:
- `no_direct_account_updates` - Blocked ALL updates with `false` condition
- `no_direct_account_deletes` - Blocked ALL deletes with `false` condition

These policies were preventing legitimate updates from account owners and admins.

## Solution

### 1. Fixed RLS Policies

#### Removed Blocking Policies:
- Dropped `no_direct_account_updates` 
- Dropped `no_direct_account_deletes`

#### Created Proper Policies:

**Update Policy** - `account_owners_admins_can_update`:
```sql
CREATE POLICY "account_owners_admins_can_update"
  ON public.accounts
  FOR UPDATE
  USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 
      FROM public.account_members 
      WHERE account_members.account_id = accounts.id 
        AND account_members.user_id = auth.uid() 
        AND account_members.role IN ('owner', 'admin')
        AND account_members.status = 'active'
    )
  )
```

**Delete Policy** - `only_account_owners_can_delete`:
```sql
CREATE POLICY "only_account_owners_can_delete"
  ON public.accounts
  FOR DELETE
  USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 
      FROM public.account_members 
      WHERE account_members.account_id = accounts.id 
        AND account_members.user_id = auth.uid() 
        AND account_members.role = 'owner'
        AND account_members.status = 'active'
    )
  )
```

### 2. Improved Error Handling

Enhanced the account settings page to:
- Return and use the updated data from the database
- Show more detailed error messages
- Log errors to console for debugging
- Update local state with actual database values

## Permissions Structure

After the fix, the permissions are:
- **SELECT**: Any authenticated user can view accounts
- **INSERT**: Any authenticated user can create accounts
- **UPDATE**: Only account owners and admins can update
- **DELETE**: Only account owners can delete

## Testing

To verify the fix works:
1. Navigate to `/settings/account`
2. Make changes to any field (name, company, address, etc.)
3. Click "Save Changes"
4. Should see success toast
5. Refresh page to confirm changes persisted

## Key Learnings

1. **RLS Policies Must Be Specific**: Blanket "false" conditions block all operations
2. **Role-Based Access**: Use account membership roles for proper access control
3. **Status Checks**: Include status = 'active' to prevent inactive members from making changes
4. **Error Feedback**: Always provide detailed error messages for better debugging

## Security Considerations

The new policies ensure:
- Only active members can modify accounts
- Admins can update but not delete accounts
- Owners have full control over their accounts
- Inactive or removed members lose access immediately
