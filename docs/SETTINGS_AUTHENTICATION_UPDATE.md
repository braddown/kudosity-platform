# Settings Pages & User Dropdown - Authentication Integration

## Overview
Updated the settings pages and user dropdown to use real data from the new Supabase authentication system instead of hardcoded mock data.

## Changes Made

### 1. Users Settings Page (`app/settings/users/page.tsx`)

**Before**: Displayed hardcoded user data
**After**: 
- Fetches real account members from `account_members` table
- Shows actual user profiles with email and names
- Displays proper roles (owner, admin, member, viewer) with badges
- Shows real join dates
- Respects current account context from cookies
- Includes role-based action restrictions

**Features Added**:
- Loading states while fetching data
- Error handling with toast notifications
- Role badges with appropriate icons
- Status badges (active, invited, suspended)
- Proper date formatting
- Action menu with edit/remove options (placeholders for future implementation)

### 2. Organization/Account Settings Page (`app/settings/organization/page.tsx`)

**Before**: Static form with hardcoded "Acme Corp" data
**After**:
- Renamed to "Account Settings" to match new terminology
- Fetches real account data from `accounts` table
- Shows actual account information (ID, name, slug, emails)
- Displays real plan and status information
- Functional save button that updates the database
- Shows account creation date

**Features Added**:
- Real-time data fetching from database
- Working save functionality for account updates
- Plan badges showing subscription status
- Danger zone for account deletion (with proper restrictions)
- Loading and saving states
- Success/error notifications

### 3. User Dropdown (`components/MainLayout.tsx`)

**Before**: Hardcoded "Brad Down" with static data
**After**:
- Fetches real user information from Supabase auth
- Shows actual user name from profile or email
- Displays current account name
- Dynamic initials based on user's actual name
- Real email address display

**Features Added**:
- Automatic user info fetching on component mount
- Dynamic initials generation
- Current account context display
- Proper sign out functionality

## Database Tables Used

### `account_members`
- Links users to accounts with roles
- Tracks membership status and join dates

### `accounts`
- Stores account information
- Contains billing and support emails
- Tracks plan and subscription status

### `user_profiles`
- Stores user profile information
- Contains full name and avatar URL

## Key Improvements

1. **Real Data**: All pages now show actual data from the database
2. **Multi-tenancy**: Respects current account context
3. **Role-Based Access**: Shows/hides actions based on user roles
4. **Error Handling**: Proper error messages and loading states
5. **Functional Updates**: Save button actually updates the database

## Testing

1. Navigate to `/settings/users` to see real account members
2. Navigate to `/settings/organization` to see and edit account details
3. Check the user dropdown (top right) to see your actual user information
4. Try saving changes in account settings to verify database updates

## Future Enhancements

- Implement user invitation system
- Add role editing functionality
- Enable user removal (with proper permissions)
- Add avatar upload for users
- Implement account logo upload
- Add more detailed audit logging
- Enable account deletion (with owner confirmation)

## Security Considerations

- All queries respect RLS policies
- Role-based restrictions on actions
- Account context validation
- Proper authentication checks

The settings pages and user dropdown now fully integrate with the new authentication system, providing a complete multi-tenant experience with real user and account data.
