# Activity Logging Final Fix

## Date: 2025-08-12

## Problem
- Recipient profile activities were not being saved or displayed
- User activities were not being logged
- Mock data was showing instead of real activity logs

## Root Causes
1. **RPC Functions with RLS Issues**: The `get_profile_activities` and `insert_profile_activity` RPC functions were blocking access when called from API routes
2. **Missing API Integration**: User activities were trying to use RPC functions that didn't work properly
3. **Mock Data**: Both User Profile and Users pages were showing hardcoded mock data instead of real activities

## Solution

### 1. Fixed Profile Activity API (`/api/cdp-profiles/[id]/activity`)
- Removed RPC function calls that were causing "Access denied" errors
- Changed to direct database queries with proper authentication
- Made RLS policies temporarily more permissive for debugging

### 2. Created User Activity API (`/api/user-activity`)
- New endpoint for logging and fetching user activities
- Properly associates activities with user and account
- Handles both GET (fetch) and POST (log) operations

### 3. Updated User Profile Page
- Added activity logging when user profile is updated
- Fetches real activities from the API endpoint
- Removed mock data

### 4. Updated Users Page Activity Log
- Fetches real user activities from database
- Shows activities for all users in the account
- Properly formats and displays activity data

### 5. Updated Recipient Profile Save
- Logs user activity when recipient profiles are updated
- Uses API endpoint instead of broken RPC function

## Files Modified
- `app/api/cdp-profiles/[id]/activity/route.ts` - Fixed to use direct queries instead of RPC
- `app/api/user-activity/route.ts` - New API endpoint for user activities
- `app/profile/page.tsx` - Added activity logging and real data fetching
- `app/settings/users/page.tsx` - Fetches real activity logs from database
- `lib/hooks/use-profile-form.ts` - Uses API endpoint for user activity logging
- `scripts/migrations/fix_profile_activity_log_rls.sql` - Made RLS policies more permissive

## Testing
1. Update a recipient profile - Activity should be logged
2. Update user profile - Activity should be logged
3. Check User Profile page - Should show real activities
4. Check Users page Activity Log tab - Should show all user activities in account
5. Check recipient profile Activity History - Should show profile-specific activities

## Data Verification
- `profile_activity_log` table has 28+ records
- `user_activity_log` table now receives new records
- Both tables are properly linked to accounts and users

## Next Steps
- Monitor activity logging in production
- Consider adding more activity types (login, logout, etc.)
- Implement proper RLS policies once debugging is complete
