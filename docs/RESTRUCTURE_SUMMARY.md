# Account Restructuring Summary

## What We Changed

We successfully restructured the multi-tenant architecture from "Organizations with Members" to "Accounts with Users as Members" to align with future scalability needs.

### Key Changes Made

#### 1. Database Migration
- **Renamed Tables:**
  - `organizations` → `accounts`
  - `organization_members` → `account_members`
  - Updated column `organization_id` → `account_id`
  - Updated all foreign key constraints
  - Updated RLS policies to use new table names

#### 2. Authentication System Updates
- **Client Authentication (`lib/auth/client.ts`):**
  - `createOrganization()` → `createAccount()`
  - `switchOrganization()` → `switchAccount()`
  - Updated cookie from `current_organization` to `current_account`
  
- **Server Authentication (`lib/auth/server.ts`):**
  - `getCurrentOrganization()` → `getCurrentAccount()`
  - Updated all queries to use `accounts` and `account_members` tables

#### 3. Frontend Components
- **Setup Page:**
  - Renamed `/auth/setup-organization` → `/auth/setup-account`
  - Updated all UI text from "organization" to "account"
  - Updated form handling and API calls

#### 4. API Routes
- **Test Endpoint:**
  - Renamed `/api/test-org` → `/api/test-account`
  - Updated to create accounts instead of organizations

#### 5. Middleware
- Updated authentication checks to use account context
- Redirects to `/auth/setup-account` for new users

#### 6. Documentation
- Created comprehensive `ACCOUNTS_ARCHITECTURE.md` documenting:
  - New multi-tenant structure
  - Database schema
  - Authentication flows
  - API patterns
  - Future organization implementation path

## Why This Change Was Important

1. **Clarity:** "Account" better represents a workspace/tenant boundary
2. **Future-Proof:** Organizations will eventually be labels for groups of accounts
3. **Scalability:** Supports enterprise customers with multiple accounts
4. **No Conflicts:** Avoids terminology conflicts when implementing true organizations

## Migration Applied

```sql
-- Successfully applied migration: 003_restructure_organizations_to_accounts
-- All tables renamed and constraints updated
-- RLS policies migrated to new structure
```

## Next Steps

The system is now ready for:
1. Testing user registration and account creation flow
2. Implementing account switching UI
3. Adding more account-specific features
4. Future organization layer implementation (Phase 2)

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Database migration applied successfully
- [x] Authentication code updated
- [x] Frontend components updated
- [x] API routes updated
- [x] Middleware updated
- [x] Build compiles with only minor warnings
- [ ] Manual testing of registration flow
- [ ] Manual testing of login flow
- [ ] Manual testing of account switching

## Known Issues

1. Build warnings about Supabase Edge Runtime compatibility (non-critical)
2. Need to test actual authentication flow with real users

## Files Modified

- Database migration: `scripts/migrations/003_restructure_organizations_to_accounts.sql`
- Auth client: `lib/auth/client.ts`
- Auth server: `lib/auth/server.ts`
- Setup page: `app/auth/setup-account/page.tsx` (renamed from setup-organization)
- Middleware: `middleware.ts`
- Test API: `app/api/test-account/route.ts` (renamed from test-org)
- Documentation: `docs/ACCOUNTS_ARCHITECTURE.md` (new)

The restructuring is complete and the codebase now properly uses "Accounts" as the primary tenant boundary, with users as members of accounts.
