# Activity Logging - Now Working!

## Issue Fixed
The problem was that `createClient()` in `lib/auth/server.ts` was changed to be async (awaiting `cookies()`), but the API routes weren't awaiting it. This caused `supabase.auth.getUser()` to fail with "Cannot read properties of undefined".

## Fix Applied
Added `await` before all `createClient()` calls in API routes:
- `app/api/cdp-profiles/[id]/activity/route.ts`
- `app/api/user-activity/route.ts`
- All other API routes were already fixed

## How Activity Logging Works Now

### 1. Recipient Profile Activities
- When you update a recipient profile, it logs to `profile_activity_log` table
- Activities are fetched via `/api/cdp-profiles/[id]/activity`
- Displayed in the "Activity History" section of the profile

### 2. User Activities
- When users perform actions (update profile, edit recipients), it logs to `user_activity_log` table
- Activities are fetched via `/api/user-activity`
- Displayed in:
  - User Profile page - "Recent Activity" section
  - Settings > Users > Activity Log tab

## Testing Instructions
1. **Restart your browser** (Cmd+Shift+R for hard refresh)
2. **Edit a Recipient Profile**:
   - Go to any recipient profile
   - Change something (e.g., name, location)
   - Click Save
   - Check the "Activity History" section - should show the update
3. **Update Your User Profile**:
   - Go to your User Profile (top-right dropdown)
   - Change something (e.g., name, timezone)
   - Click Save
   - Check "Recent Activity" section - should show the update
4. **Check Account Activity Log**:
   - Go to Settings > Users > Activity Log tab
   - Should show all user activities in the account

## Database Verification
- `profile_activity_log` table contains recipient profile changes
- `user_activity_log` table contains user actions
- Both tables are properly linked to accounts and users

## Console Logs
You should see in the browser console:
- "Successfully fetched profile: {...}" when loading a profile
- "Attempting to log property update for [field]" when saving
- "Successfully logged property update" after successful logging
- "User activity logged successfully" after user actions
