#### 9. Overview.tsx (607 lines) 游리 MEDIUM PRIORITY
- **Issues**: Multiple dashboard widgets and responsibilities
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Overview statistics
  - Multiple dashboard widgets
  - Real-time data updates
  - Quick action buttons
- **Refactoring Plan**: Split into OverviewContainer, StatsWidgets, QuickActions, RecentActivity

## Client/Server Boundary Violations

### Current State Analysis

**Components with "use client" directive**: 80+ components
**Estimated actual client components needed**: ~30-40 components

### Problematic Patterns

1. **Blanket "use client" Usage**
   - Almost every component uses "use client"
   - Many components don't require client-side features
   - Server-side rendering opportunities missed

2. **Potential Server Components** (components that likely don't need "use client"):
   - Static display components
   - Layout components without interactivity
   - Server-side data fetching components
   - Pure presentational components

3. **Legitimate Client Components** (components that do need "use client"):
   - Form components with state
   - Interactive UI elements (buttons with onClick)
   - Components using browser APIs
   - Real-time components with WebSocket connections

### Recommended Client/Server Separation

#### Server Components (Remove "use client")
- Layout components (Header, Footer, etc.)
- Static content displays
- Server-side data fetching wrappers
- Pure presentational components

#### Client Components (Keep "use client")  
- Form components with useState
- Interactive elements with event handlers
- Components using browser APIs (localStorage, etc.)
- Real-time/WebSocket components
- Components with useEffect for client-side logic

## Refactoring Guidelines

### Component Size Limits
- **Maximum recommended**: 300 lines
- **Warning threshold**: 200 lines  
- **Critical threshold**: 500+ lines

### Single Responsibility Principle
- Each component should have one clear purpose
- Complex logic should be extracted to custom hooks
- Business logic should be separated from UI logic

### Client/Server Boundaries
- Only use "use client" when necessary
- Prefer server components for static content
- Wrap server components with client components when needed
- Document the reason for each "use client" usage

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Priority**: Refactor Logs.tsx and Contacts.tsx (>1000 lines)
2. **High Priority**: Refactor ProfilePage.tsx and ChatApp.tsx (800-999 lines)
3. **Medium Priority**: Address remaining components >600 lines
4. **Cleanup**: Review and optimize client/server boundaries

## Success Metrics

- Reduce average component size by 60%
- Achieve <300 lines per component maximum
- Reduce "use client" usage by 50%
- Maintain 100% functionality during refactoring
- Improve build performance and bundle size
