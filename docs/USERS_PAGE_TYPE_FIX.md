# Users Page Type Mismatch Fix

## Problem
The Users page was still showing "No users found in this account" even after creating the `get_account_members` RPC function. The browser console showed errors about failed RPC calls.

## Root Cause
The RPC function had type mismatches between the declared return types and the actual database column types:
1. `role` and `status` were declared as `TEXT` but are `VARCHAR(50)` in the database
2. `email` and `full_name` were declared as `TEXT` but are `VARCHAR(255)` in the database

## Solution
Fixed the RPC function to use exact matching types.

### Database Function Update

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_account_members(p_account_id UUID)
RETURNS TABLE (
  id UUID,
  user_id UUID,
  account_id UUID,
  role VARCHAR(50),      -- Changed from TEXT
  status VARCHAR(50),    -- Changed from TEXT
  joined_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
  email VARCHAR(255),    -- Changed from TEXT
  full_name VARCHAR(255), -- Changed from TEXT
  avatar_url TEXT
)
```

### Debugging Added
Added console logging to help diagnose issues:
```typescript
console.log('Fetching members for account:', accountId)
const { data: membersData, error: membersError } = await supabase
  .rpc('get_account_members', { p_account_id: accountId })

console.log('Members data:', membersData)
console.log('Members error:', membersError)
```

## Testing Results
The RPC function now successfully returns data:
```json
{
  "id": "659892df-f7c7-4ca6-96ba-64d5aa93dc51",
  "user_id": "03f6e82f-36d2-4b95-a559-b4e7228e4be1",
  "account_id": "bd84f8ed-f9e3-4457-a1a8-6c29fbf29e96",
  "role": "owner",
  "status": "active",
  "joined_at": "2025-08-11 02:44:36.618404+00",
  "email": "brad@kudosity.com",
  "full_name": "Brad Down",
  "avatar_url": ""
}
```

## Key Lesson
When creating database functions that return tables, the declared return types must **exactly match** the actual column types in the database. PostgreSQL is strict about type matching, and even `TEXT` vs `VARCHAR(255)` will cause errors.

## Next Steps
1. Clear browser cache/cookies if needed
2. Navigate to `/settings/users`
3. The page should now display the logged-in user with their role
4. Remove debug console.log statements once confirmed working
