# User Profile Activity Panel Removal

## Date: 2025-08-12

## Overview
Removed the Recent Activity panel from the User Profile page (`/profile`) as this information is more relevant for account administrators rather than individual users.

## Rationale
- Activity logging is account-level information useful for administrators
- Individual users don't need to see their own activity history on their profile
- This information remains available in the Settings > Users > Activity Log for administrators
- Reduces clutter on the User Profile page

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Components
- Removed the Activity Log Card from the UI
- Removed activity fetching from the API
- Removed activity state management

### 2. Code Cleanup
- Removed `UserActivity` interface
- Removed `activities` state variable
- Removed `setActivities` function calls
- Removed activity data fetching from `/api/user-activity`
- Removed activity refresh after profile updates
- Removed Activity icon import (no longer needed)

### 3. Files Modified
- `app/profile/page.tsx` - Removed all activity-related code

## UI Impact
- User Profile page is now cleaner and more focused on user information
- Profile Information section remains
- Location Settings section remains
- Account Memberships section remains
- Activity tracking continues to work in the background for administrators

## Where Activity Information Remains Available
- **Settings > Users > Activity Log** - For account administrators to view all user activities
- **Recipient Profiles** - Activity history for individual recipient profiles
- Activity logging continues to function normally, just not displayed on user profiles

## Benefits
1. **Cleaner UI** - Less clutter on the User Profile page
2. **Better Separation** - Clear distinction between user information and administrative data
3. **Improved Focus** - User Profile now focuses solely on user-specific settings
4. **Maintained Functionality** - Activity logging still works for administrators
