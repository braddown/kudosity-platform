# Activity Logging - Complete Implementation

## Date: 2025-08-12

## Status: ✅ FULLY WORKING

## What's Working Now

### 1. Recipient Profile Activity
- ✅ Activities are saved when profiles are updated
- ✅ Activity History displays correctly on profile pages
- ✅ Shows who made changes and when

### 2. User Activity Logging
- ✅ RLS policies fixed - activities can now be saved
- ✅ User Profile page shows activities
- ✅ Settings > Users > Activity Log shows all account activities
- ✅ Both pages pull from the same `user_activity_log` table

## Final Fixes Applied

### 1. API Route Authentication Fix
- Added `await` before all `createClient()` calls
- Fixed "Cannot read properties of undefined" errors

### 2. RLS Policy Fix for user_activity_log
```sql
-- Allow authenticated users to insert their own activities
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can insert their own activities"
ON user_activity_log FOR INSERT
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Allow users to view activities in their account
CREATE POLICY "Users can view all activities in their account"
ON user_activity_log FOR SELECT
TO authenticated
USING (
  account_id IN (
    SELECT account_id 
    FROM account_members 
    WHERE user_id = auth.uid() 
    AND status = 'active'
  )
);
```

### 3. Sample Data Added
- Profile update activities
- Recipient profile update activities
- Login activities

## Data Flow

### When User Updates Their Profile:
1. User saves changes in `/profile`
2. API call to `/api/user-activity` (POST)
3. Activity saved to `user_activity_log` table
4. Displayed in:
   - User Profile > Recent Activity
   - Settings > Users > Activity Log

### When User Updates Recipient Profile:
1. User saves changes in recipient profile
2. Two activities are logged:
   - Profile activity in `profile_activity_log`
   - User activity in `user_activity_log`
3. Displayed in:
   - Recipient Profile > Activity History
   - Settings > Users > Activity Log

## Database Tables

### user_activity_log
- Stores all user actions (login, profile updates, recipient edits)
- Linked to user_id and account_id
- Has proper RLS policies for security

### profile_activity_log
- Stores recipient profile-specific changes
- Shows detailed history of profile modifications
- Linked to profile_id and performed_by (user_id)

## Testing Verification
1. ✅ Recipient Profile activities display and update
2. ✅ User Profile activities display
3. ✅ Settings > Users > Activity Log shows all activities
4. ✅ New activities are logged when changes are made
5. ✅ RLS policies allow proper access

## Next Steps (Optional)
- Add more activity types (logout, password change, etc.)
- Add activity filtering and search
- Add activity export functionality
- Add activity retention policies
